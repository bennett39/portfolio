    p.
      I have a goal of reading all the Pulitzer Prize winning novels. However, every time I go to the library,
      I have to look up a list of the winners and remember which ones I've already read. This site is a basic
      checklist that solves that problem.
    p.
      The backend is a Django application that uses REST Framework to serialize Book and Author models.
      Postgres database. Front end is React using CSS flexbox. Makes AJAX calls to the API when a checkbox
      is clicked.

    p.
      An anonymous chat application that uses SocketIO to instantly push

    p.
      Uses jQuery and the SocketIO client on the frontend. NodeJS
      backend. All message data is stored client-side, meaning chats
      disappear once you've left the session and the backend has no
      storage overhead.

      consistent for all users.
